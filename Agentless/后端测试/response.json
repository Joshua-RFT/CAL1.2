Changes the operation from exponentiation (`**`) to addition (`+`)\n2. Maintains the same function signature and indentation\n3. Will make the function return the sum of the two inputs as expected\n\nThe bug was localized to the `add()` function in `final_test/utils.py` where it was performing the wrong mathematical operation. The fix ensures it now performs addition as intended by the user."
